Goals for Meeting: 
- Present Implementation with new criteria

Meeting notes:
- Showed LZW question generator implementation.
- Generates a random string using alphabet with constraints (min length, repeats, no long runs).
- Ensures each symbol appears at least twice and required repeating substrings exist.
- Outputs full question: input text, dictionary steps, encoded output, and bit calculations.

To-Do:
- Next step is to make the input more dynamic and fully test the improved version.
