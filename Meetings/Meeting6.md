Goals for Meeting:
- Present Basic Criteria for LZW & Dijkstra

Meeting notes:
- Changed problem to LZW (more original diss - doesn't involve adding upon previous dissertation)
- Current criteria is far too variable, need to restrict what the expected values of question are as that makes it easier to control the difficulty


To-Do:
- Enhance criteria with LZW as the focus (restricting to specific expected values)
